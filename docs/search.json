About 15% on average are missing across these variables except for the Other variable which has too many missing values i.e. ~ 71%\nWith exception the Diabetes variables which has 5 distinct values, the other variables have too many distinct values to be considered in a model esp. with a sample size of 155.

The controversy lies mostly for effect estimation rather than for prediction goals. However, when the number of variables remaining in the model is either small or large compared to the total number of candidates, then it’s more acceptable as a method. Here, just 2 out of the 7 variables (involved in 25 model terms) remain in the model after BE. The variables are also not highly correlated. In addition, the calibration section below indicates good out-of-sample probability behavior.\nBy keeping only Age and Mental_DisorderV2 as predictors in the model, the model is parsimonious with having only two variables explaining the variation of the HC/MCI/AD grouping, while at the same time retaining model performance. For example, the C rank discrimination index is ~ 82.26% for the full model when accounting for sampling variation, while it is ~ 82.46% for the reduced model and after accounting for both sampling variation and the variable selection process.\n\n\nSince more than half of candidate variables are redundant, the full model is also slightly less accurate than the reduced one.\nThese are the frequencies of entered terms in the model, in the 300 bootstrap samples i.e. simulation, sorted in decreasing order:\n\n\n                               Age                  Mental_DisorderV2                     Lung_DiseaseV2                             Gender \n                               300                                295                                 75                                 68 \n           Age * Mental_DisorderV2        DiabetesV2 * Lung_DiseaseV2            Gender * Lung_DiseaseV2         Gender * Mental_DisorderV2 \n                                61                                 39                                 24                                 23 \n               Gender * DiabetesV2 Lung_DiseaseV2 * Mental_DisorderV2 \n                                15                                 15",

    "text": "Model Likelihood Ratio Statistic (LR)\nThere is a large number of candidate biomarkers i.e. 383 lipids. These are highly correlated and it is computationally difficult to fit a penalized model containing all lipids simultaneously. To assess the predictive value of each lipid on its own, but at the same time allow it to be adjusted for a fixed set of clinical variables, the bootstrap is used to get confidence intervals on importance ranks of all candidate features. Assessing each lipid on its own also has the merit of measuring its impact free from the other lipids in the network because including other lipids would mean adjustment for these additional lipids too, and this would dilute the assessment.\n(Note: accounting for correlations in a lipid network is considered in the section below, titled Network Graph Estimates)\nThe importance measure used here is the gold standard likelihood ratio LR statistic of a model with 3 degrees of freedom compared to the null model. It does not matter that this statistic counts the Age and Mental_DisorderV2 effects, as we will be comparing all the 3 degrees of freedom LR statistics with different lipids in the model, but with Age & Mental_DisorderV2 always present i.e. lipids are adjusted for Age & Mental_DisorderV2.\nAs mentioned in the data processing section, the lipid data have been combined i.e. negative and positive ionization, and then log transformed and divided by 15. In addition, to facilitate easier data manipulation, the lipid names have been altered using the following logic e.g. LN1 means Lipid with Negative ionization and in the 1st column of the negative ionization data set; LP11 means Lipid with Positive ionization and in the 11th column of the positive ionization data set. These code names have been mapped to the actual lipid names, so that the real lipid names can be extracted with the final results.\nHere is an excerpt of the data after being merged with Age & Mental_DisorderV2, with two randomly selected negative ionization lipids and two positive ionization lipids:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nInitially, using the original data as above, each lipid is added separately in a model that includes Age & Mental_DisorderV2 as predictors, and the model’s LR statistic is extracted.

    "text": "Relative Explained Variation (REV)\nConducting an anova on the model containing Age, Mental_DisorderV2 and FFA_10_2 gives the Chi-Square statistic which is an indicator of variable importance. This was seen previously on the table called Wald Statistics for groupV2 above. Relative explained variation is a procedure that estimates the accuracy of these statistics under repeated sampling, and produces confidence intervals for them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: It can be seen that there is overlap in the confidence regions of each predictor. Due to the small sample size of 155 observations, the intervals are quite wide. Age is clearly the most important variable especially when compared to Mental_DisorderV2. FFA_10_2 aka LN3 seems more important than Mental_DisorderV2, but only marginally due to the CI overlap. This confirms the previous result of FFA_10_2 having an FDR adjusted p-value of about 4%, and hence being marginally significant at the 5% level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FFA_10_2 lipid adds a fraction of 0.18 of new diagnostic information to Age and Mental_DisorderV2. In terms of percentage to total REV, this is 29% compared to the model’s total of 64%.\nTo further visualize the diagnostic yield of FFA_10_2, the plot below estimates the with FFA_10_2 vs without FFA_10_2 risk probability for each of the threes state transitions. Quantile regression is used to estimate the 0.1 and 0.9 quantiles of the with risk as a function of the without risk. This allows one to readily see the typical changes in a without probability once FFA_10_2 is known and added in the base model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Risk of condition severity: When in HC status, the probability of having either MCI or AD status. X-axis corresponds to the model without the FFA_10_2 lipid, while Y-axis corresponds to the model with the FFA_10_2 lipid. At each x-axis probability, compare the width of the quantile solid curves on each side of the diagonal line in order to assess how inclusion of the lipid changes the probability of risk. The mirror 90% quantile has been plotted to help with this assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Risk of having AD when either in HC or MCI state. See previous plot for interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy plotting the without-with model risk difference vs Age we can easily see the dependence on Age of the added value of the FFA_10_2 lipid.

    "section": "Proportional Odds Assumption (PO)",
    "text": "Proportional Odds Assumption (PO)\nTwo types of excess probabilities are calculated by the model:\n\nThe probability or risk of a patient’s condition to worsen i.e. the probability to transition from the HC status to either the MCI or the AD status. This is denoted in model output results and visuals as y&gt;=MCI.\nThe probability or risk of a patient to be diagnosed with AD i.e. the probability to transition from either the HC or the MCI status to the AD status. This is denoted in model output results and visuals as y&gt;=AD.\n\nThe PO assumption dictates that the partial effect (i.e. model coefficient) of each predictor variable on the outcome is the same in both of the above probability types 1 and 2. This is a reasonable assumption for many severity type outcomes that are also not discontinuous i.e. the outcome categorization is not a hard one. Indeed, the outcome category definitions have been based on the MMSE index (see data processing page) which is on a scale from 0 to 30, with decreasing values denoting higher disease severity. Medical professionals have split this index into three parts in order to define the three categories of HC, MCI and AD, and such a split is arbitrary.\nThe model type including the PO assumption is also appropriate when the sample size is not large i.e. 155 observations, and especially when the outcome group sizes are unbalanced i.e. the HC group contains only 22 cases, while the MCI group has 44 and the AD 89. This is because a smaller number of parameters are fit i.e. fewer degrees of freedom are spent, and hence the model can be expected to have good out of sample performance and probability calibration properties.\nWhen the PO assumption for a predictor is violated, the alternative is to relax the assumption for such a predictor and fit a partial proportional odds model (PPO). Relaxing the assumption means adding a parameter for each such case, and thus fitting a more complex model. However, due to the sample size issues mentioned above, the PPO model will be more appropriate when more data are collected. In addition, it will be seen below that current PO violations do not seem to be severe, and mostly occur due to the data imbalance of the HC outcome group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28: Model residuals i.e. comparing observed with predicted responses for each excess grouping ie. MCI and AD. Mean +- 1.96 standard errors are also shown. PO assumption is violated when the mean values of the residuals for each group MCI and AD deviate from each other i.e. they are not on the same horizontal level.\n\n\n\nThere is some violation of the assumption for terms involving the Mental_DisorderV2 variable. However since the confidence limits include zero, the violation is not alarming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: Partial model residuals i.e. when adjusting for the other predictors in the model. PO assumption is violated when the curves are not parallel to each other.\n\n\n\nA more rigorous approach to test the PO assumption is by comparing predicted cell probabilities from a PO model with those from a multinomial or partial proportional odds logistic model (PPO) that relax assumptions. Since the multinomial model is not appropriate as mentioned above, only the PPO model is considered as the alternative. This is executed below (where LN3 is the FFA_10_2 lipid).\n\n\n                          PO     PPO   \nDeviance                  186.68 177.18\nd.f.                      7      8     \nAIC                       200.68 193.18\np                         5      6     \nLR chi^2                  108.79 118.29\nLR - p                    103.79 112.29\nLR chi^2 test for PO             9.49  \n  d.f.                            1    \n  Pr(&gt;chi^2)                     0.0021\nMCS R2                    0.504  0.534 \nMCS R2 adj                0.488  0.515 \nMcFadden R2               0.368  0.400 \nMcFadden R2 adj           0.334  0.360 \nMean |difference| from PO        0.078 \n\nCovariate combination-specific mean |difference| in predicted probabilities\n\n  method Age Mental_DisorderV2    LN3 Mean |difference|\n1    PPO  43            DepAnx 0.9717             0.146\n2    PPO  73            DepAnx 0.9717             0.032\n3    PPO  43                No 0.9717             0.047\n4    PPO  73                No 0.9717             0.088\n\nBootstrap 0.95 confidence intervals for differences in model predicted\nprobabilities based on 300 bootstraps\n\n\n  Age Mental_DisorderV2    LN3\n1  43            DepAnx 0.9717\n\nPO - PPO probability estimates\n\n          HC   MCI     AD\nLower -0.392 0.050 -0.051\nUpper -0.050 0.376  0.016\n\n  Age Mental_DisorderV2    LN3\n2  73            DepAnx 0.9717\n\nPO - PPO probability estimates\n\n          HC   MCI     AD\nLower -0.042 0.009 -0.058\nUpper -0.005 0.100 -0.003\n\n  Age Mental_DisorderV2    LN3\n3  43                No 0.9717\n\nPO - PPO probability estimates\n\n         HC    MCI    AD\nLower 0.002 -0.372 0.000\nUpper 0.363 -0.003 0.016\n\n  Age Mental_DisorderV2    LN3\n4  73                No 0.9717\n\nPO - PPO probability estimates\n\n         HC    MCI    AD\nLower 0.013 -0.230 0.037\nUpper 0.079 -0.052 0.165\n\n\nThe output above indicates that the largest differences in predicted probabilities from the PO model occur at younger ages i.e. 43 and for cases of depression or anxiety in the Mental_DisorderV2 variable. These results are expected as they correspond to subsets of the data without many instances. Specifically, there are only 4 cases in the data having Age &lt; 45 & Mental_DisorderV2 = DepAnx.\nFor older Age cases, there is violation of the PO for the Mental_DisorderV2 variable, but this seems to be marginal as the value of 0 is very close to either the upper or lower bootstrap CIs for the probability differences between the PO and the PPO models.\nLooking at the AIC statistic (the lower the better) and the low p-value for the chi^2 test for PO of 0.0021, it seems that it would be valuable to relax the PO assumption for the Mental_DisorderV2 variable in the model. However, due to the data restrictions at lower ages and model stability issues, currently this relaxation is not done.\nNote that the above test for PO analysis was also done for the variables Age and LN3 (FFA_10_2), and the results did not show any violation of the PO assumption.",

    "text": "Network Graph Estimates\nThis section presents another approach in biomarker discovery that is based on partial correlation networks.\nIn a separate analysis, partial correlation network graphs were estimated for each of the three groups, using the following procedure:\n\nUsing high dimensional undirected graph estimation methodology, estimate the graph using only the HC observations, and extract the optimal parameter that characterizes the graph.\nUsing the optimal graph parameter from step 1, estimate a new graph using only the observations from the MCI group.\nUsing the optimal graph parameter from step 1, estimate a new graph using only the observations from the AD group.\n\nThe resulting network graph estimates were saved in an interactive dashboard as shown in the below screenshots. Interactivity here primarily means that each lipid (shown as a network node) can be separately selected on the dashboard in order to better visualise its connections and partial-correlations to other lipids within the network. In addition, as the sample correlation matrices show, neighboring lipid concentrations on the data matrix happen to be highly correlated and to form subgroups of potentially relevant biochemicals. It is interesting to observe that the subgroup patterns across the main diagonal are becoming more evident with increasing disease severity from the HC to the AD groups.\nWith regards to the next screenshot of partial correlation network graphs, these subgroups of lipids have been given a different node color in the network in order to be more easily identifiable. Here, it can be observed how the node connections seem to fall apart as one moves in disease severity, and going from a state of high network entropy i.e. the HC state, to a gradual reduction of entropy from the MCI state to the AD state. This leads to clusters of sub-networks in AD graph, which are not identifiable in the HC graph i.e. the HC graph has been split into smaller subgraphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Correlation Matrices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial Correlation Network Graphs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30\n\n\n\nAs the next analysis step, for each lipid, a three index predictor set is derived based on the network graph estimates i.e. an index for each of the three graphs of HC, MCI and AD. For each lipid, each such index contains the partial effects or correlations of the lipid with the rest of the lipids, and hence it is an index that takes into account the existence of the lipid within a network of all other lipids. In statistical jargon, the index considers each lipid’s conditional dependence (having connections) or independence (no connections) from the other lipids in the network. In addition, the strength of a connection i.e. the magnitude of the partial correlation, is also taken into account.\nBelow an example is shown of a three index predictor set for lipid with code name LN1 on the log(x)/15 transformed scale:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nModel Likelihood Ratio Statistic (LR)\nAs done previously for the raw lipid concentrations, each lipid index is added separately in a model that includes Age & Mental_DisorderV2 as predictors, and the model’s LR statistic is extracted. Then the lipid indices are ranked so that top ranks correspond to the highest LR values. Below is a histogram showing the distribution of the LR statistics.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n3 to 5 d.f.

This means that the FFA_10_2 lipid is conditionally independent from the other lipids in the network, and its effect is isolated. This is also verified by the fact that from the three indices corresponding to the three groups HC, MCI and AD, only the HC index is needed in the model for the FFA_10_2 lipid i.e. in the result above the only coefficient name used is lipidNet_HC instead of lipidNet_HC:lipidNet_MCI:lipidNet_AD as with the other lipids.\nFitting a model with the top lipid index and conducting an LR test i.e. anova, gives:\n\n\nLogistic Regression Model\n \n lrm(formula = groupV2 ~ Age + Mental_DisorderV2 + LN3_HC, data = dplyr::select(proc2_HC_fitted_allData, \n     groupV2, Age, Mental_DisorderV2, LN3_HC), x = TRUE, y = TRUE)\n \n                        Model Likelihood      Discrimination    Rank Discrim.    \n                              Ratio Test             Indexes          Indexes    \n Obs           155    LR chi2     103.38      R2       0.572    C       0.887    \n  HC            22    d.f.             3      R2(3,155)0.477    Dxy     0.775    \n  MCI           44    Pr(&gt; chi2) &lt;0.0001    R2(3,121.7)0.562    gamma   0.776    \n  AD            89                            Brier    0.099    tau-a   0.444    \n max |deriv| 1e-06                                                               \n \n                          Coef    S.E.

To account for sampling variation, the previous procedure is in addition bootstrapped 300 times, and the results are combined in order to get nonparametric percentile confidence intervals for the lipid index ranks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Bootstrap distribution of Chi-Square LR statistics from 5 degrees of freedom models, having Age, Mental_DisorderV2 and each lipid index of disease severity group separately as predictor variables. For the index of lipid FFA_10_2, the model spends 3 degrees of freedom as only one of the group indices is needed. Comparison between the selected FFA_10_2 i.e. LN3 lipid index with the rest of the 383 lipids. It can be seen that there is bimodality and that the selected lipid separates itself towards higher LR values compared to the other lipids. The separation is more evident when compared to the one obtained from the model containing the lipid in isolation i.e. see Figure 11 using the vertical dashed lines for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, using the quantiles of the bootstrapped rank distribution, the central 95% interval is:\n\n\n 2.5% 97.5% \n  1.0  92.5 \n\n\nThe FFA_10_2 index was replicated as the winner in at least 2.5% of the bootstrap resamples, but the upper confidence interval limit shows that the data are consistent with the FFA_10_2 index being in the 1/4.15 higher upper part of the 384 features’ importance i.e. 92.5 compared to 384/4.15 ~ 92.5.\nWhile the 0-80 interval is:\n\n\n 0% 80% \n  1  22 \n\n\nThe FFA_10_2 lipid index happens to be in the top 22 rank about 80% of the time.\n\n\nThe model & analysis shown in this section for the FFA_10_2 lipid index aka LN3_HC indicates that a network index can provide added predictive value when compared to the raw lipid concentration variable FFA_10_2 aka LN3. This does not mean that the lipid index should necessarily replace the raw concentration in the model. A result of the following section is that when accounting for the interaction of the lipid with Age & Mental_DisorderV2 variables, then it is better to keep the raw lipid concentration in the model instead of the its index version.\nThe model based on the FFA_10_2 lipid index only uses 3 degrees of freedom, just like was the case when the lipid was considered in isolation previously. However, the rest of the indices are based on a 5 degrees of freedom model. Hence it is expected that they will have a higher LR statistic i.e. better model fit. To make the comparison more fair, a pooled anova version is used below such that for each of the above indices a pooled version of the p-value estimate is calculated i.e. the p-values of each index in the triplet lipidNet_HC:lipidNet_MCI:lipidNet_AD are pooled together.

The lipids are entered in both their raw concentration form if they are shown to be conditionally independent in the network or in their lipid index form in case they have connections within the network. Interactions amongst the variables are also considered while respecting the 12 degrees of freedom cap before significant overfitting occurs. The criteria for lipid selection in the model are out of sample performance, control for overfitting the sample data, as well as how good the predicted probabilities are calibrated.\nThe resulting model is as follows:\n\n\nLogistic Regression Model\n \n lrm(formula = groupV2 ~ Age + Mental_DisorderV2 + LN3 + Mental_DisorderV2 * \n     LN3 + Age * LN3 + LN109 + LP158, data = dat_temp, x = TRUE, \n     y = TRUE, scale = TRUE)\n \n                        Model Likelihood      Discrimination    Rank Discrim.    \n                              Ratio Test             Indexes          Indexes    \n Obs           155    LR chi2     129.64      R2       0.666    C       0.916    \n  HC            22    d.f.             7      R2(7,155)0.547    Dxy     0.831    \n  MCI           44    Pr(&gt; chi2) &lt;0.0001    R2(7,121.7)0.635    gamma   0.832    \n  AD            89                            Brier    0.085    tau-a   0.477    \n max |deriv| 7e-07                                                               \n \n                                Coef      S.E.

The x-axis indicates the risk severity probability. There are regions of predicted probability where the expectation would be of a bit worse performance from the apparent one i.e. the one based on the observed sample data. There is some underestimation below the 0.65 predicted value, while there is some overestimation for predicted values above this threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35: Actual versus predicted probabilities for the base model including the FFA_10_2 lipid as predictor, its interaction with both Age and Mental_DisorderV2 as well as the lipids PE(18:0/18:0) and PC(18:0/18:0)_pos. The x-axis indicates the risk severity probability. The model appears well calibrated with small mean absolute error. Compared to the model of section 3.4, there is a reduction in mean absolute error of about 82%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36: It can be seen that there is overlap in the confidence regions of each predictor. Due to the small sample size of 155 observations, the intervals are quite wide.
